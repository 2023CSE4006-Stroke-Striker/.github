# Stroke Striker


## Getting Started

 Our model is an "active" stroke detector.â€¨
 stroke has a reliable pre-hospital diagnostic method called BE-FAST (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arm, Speech, Terrible headache). 
 Among them, Facial expression changes caused by paralysis of facial muscles are very obvious so we can make a relatively accurate diagnosis.
  
  Especially in the case of refrigerators, we know empirically that everyone opens it at least once a day, even if there's no specific reason. 
  So, we use it. We make the refrigerator be equipped with a camera module to recognize the facial expressions of the user when standing in front of it. 
  
  If stroke was detected, it informs the user right away.
