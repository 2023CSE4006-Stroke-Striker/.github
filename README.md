## Getting Started

 Our model is an "active" stroke detector.â€¨
 stroke has a reliable pre-hospital diagnostic method called BE-FAST (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arm, Speech, Terrible headache). 
 Among them, Facial expression changes caused by paralysis of facial muscles are very obvious so we can make a relatively accurate diagnosis.
  
  Especially in the case of refrigerators, we know empirically that everyone opens it at least once a day, even if there's no specific reason. 
  So, we use it. We make the refrigerator be equipped with a camera module to recognize the facial expressions of the user when standing in front of it. 
  
  If stroke was detected, it informs the user right away.

## I. Introduction

## II. Datasets

To develop and train our model, we used a dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains 5029 images categorized into two classes. One class represents individuals diagnosed with acute stroke, while the other class represents individuals without such a diagnosis. 

To improve the model's accuracy, data augmentation techniques such as image flipping, rotation, and scaling were applied. These techniques contribute to creating a varied and resilient dataset, more reflective of real-world scenarios.

The dataset provides a large and diverse collection of images for training machine learning models to detect and diagnose strokes in patients. 

The augmentation techniques employed ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of scenarios, improving its ability to generalize and make accurate predictions in real-world situations.
