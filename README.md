## I. Introduction

Health is one of the most important factors in a person’s life. The increase in life expectancy over the years, due to the development of technology and healthcare, has made precaution measures against diseases much harder to take.

Stroke is a worldwide acute and severe disease, ranked as the fourth cause of death in South Korea and the fifth cause of death in the United States of America.

There are cases where the elderly are reluctant to go to the hospital due to their habits or due to their misunderstandings arising from their experiences.

However, this problem is not only defined to the older generation. A growing number of people have started living alone and because of that, they aren’t able to point out their unhealthy habits and if they get an acute disease, they won’t be able to take the proper measures to take care of themselves.

The best time to arrive at the hospital after the occurrence of a stroke is within one hour, which is a very short period of time. Fortunately, stroke has a reliable pre-hospital diagnostic method called BE-FAST (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arm, Speech, Terrible headache) that analyzes facial expression changes caused by paralysis of facial muscles; this is an obvious symptom of stroke to detect.

In this context, we thought of designing a preemptive and active health care service: a system that periodically checks the health of the people living in a household, both single-person households and old people homes, in order to detect signs of diseases in advance.

Research could be conducted afterwards using AI to study those facial expressions that correlate to certain diseases, so that in the future, people could relate those early factors to known illnesses.

If this health check service was supported by every home appliance, we could imagine a household that actively protects our health on a daily basis and not just any ordinary household that passively neglects dangerous health issues.

## II. Datasets

To develop and train our model, we used a dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains 5029 images categorized into two classes. One class represents individuals diagnosed with acute stroke, while the other class represents individuals without such a diagnosis. 

To improve the model's accuracy, data augmentation techniques such as image flipping, rotation, and scaling were applied. These techniques contribute to creating a varied and resilient dataset, more reflective of real-world scenarios.

The dataset provides a large and diverse collection of images for training machine learning models to detect and diagnose strokes in patients. 

The augmentation techniques employed ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of scenarios, improving its ability to generalize and make accurate predictions in real-world situations.
